Hi ðŸ‘‹

Some info about me:

- Iâ€™m @larswolterssoftware, a Dutch full stack developer with over 7 years of (professional) experience
- Iâ€™m interested in coding (now that's a relief), sports (running and padel), and video games when I got plenty of free time on my hands
- You can reach out to me via email, info@larswoltersoftware.nl
- I do full stack development as my 9-5 and for my own small business

I do projects profesionally next to my 9-5. If you are interested in getting a MVP up and running or a complete product, feel free to reach out.

### Stack

- Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS or TALL stack (depends on what we're building)
- Backend: PHP & Laravel

I use Notion for taking notes, JetBrains IDEs for coding and email.

A developer doesn't need a lot.
