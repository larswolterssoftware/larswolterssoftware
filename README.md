- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @larswolterssoftware, a full stack developer with over 7 years of professional experience
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding, sports, games
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via info@larswoltersoftware.nl
- âš¡ I do full stack development full time and as a freelancer

I do projects profesionally next to my 9-5. If you are interested in getting a MVP up and running or a complete product: see email above.

No idea is too crazy for realisation (or at least attempting to).
